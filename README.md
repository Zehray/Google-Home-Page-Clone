# Google-Home-Page-Clone

I designed the clone of the google home page for turkey and I used just HTML and CSS. 
I learned how to work the attribute of focus-within during the designing. 
You can see screenshots of the page and you can also visit the page. 
If you have any suggestions to improve it, you can share with me.
